### Test Driven Development <TDD>
Test driven Development is a software development process where you write tests before writing software code.
Once the tests has been written, you then write the code to ensure the tests pass. 
This process involves three phases which are : 
- Create tests that verify the functionality of a specific feature.
- Write software code that will run the tests successfully when re-executed.
- Refactor the code for optimization while ensuring the tests continue to pass.
